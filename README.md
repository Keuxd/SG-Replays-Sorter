# About
This project is a program that sorts replays from skullgirls.

# How it works
The program will get all your replay files and put them in a folder based on the players names and when that replay was recorded.
Since 1 replay has 2 players, a replay file will generate 2 folders with the same replay.

Example: A match played between SF and DS
SF(folder) -> date(folder) -> replay_files(.ini | .rnd)
DS(folder) -> date(folder) -> replay_files(.ini | .rnd)

# How to use
Put the program inside your replays folder and run it.
Remember your replays folder will have files like: "round_0001.ini" / "round_0001.rnd"
So if you want to watch this replay in replay theater just put it back in replays folder and make sure they are in order(round_0001,round_0002, ...)

In order to run the compiled .jar file you'll need Java 8, which can be found at [oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html).
