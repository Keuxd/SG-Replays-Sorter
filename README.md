# About
This project is a program that sorts replays from skullgirls.

# How it works
The program will get all your replay files and put them in a folder based on the players names and when that replay was recorded.  

>If a player has an invalid character in nickname the replay will be placed in a folder named "Unkown Players"

Example: A match played between SF and DS  
- SF Vs DS(folder) -> date(folder) -> replay_files(.ini & .rnd)  

# How to use
Put the program inside your replay folder and run it.

When you want to watch a replay in replay theater just put it back in replay folder and make sure they are in order(round_0001, 0002, ...)

>Remember that your replay folder is the one that have files like: "round_0001.ini" / "round_0001.rnd"
