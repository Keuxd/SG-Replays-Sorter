# About
This project is a program that sorts replays from skullgirls.

# How it works
The program will get all your replay files and put them ordered in a folder based on the players names and when that replay was recorded.  

Example: A match played between SF and DS  
- SF Vs DS(folder) -> date(folder) -> replay_files(.ini & .rnd)  

>If a player has an invalid character in nickname the replay will be placed in a folder named "Unkown Players"

# How to use
Put the program inside your replay folder and run it.

When you want to watch a replay in replay theater just choose the match and the date and put all files back in replay folder.

>Remember that your replay folder is the one that have files like: "round_0001.ini" / "round_0001.rnd"
